## Course Project Overview ##

For Getting and Cleaning Data course from John Hopkins University

This project is designed to demonstrate the student's ability to collect, 
work with, and clean a data set for subsequent analysis.

## Source ##

The data used in this project can be found at:

A full description of the data is available from The UCI Machine 
Learning Repository at:

## Modifying this script ##

After downloading and unzipping the source files, the only other 
modification that should be necessary is on line 32; for this line you should 
replace the path of the working directory to the location of the source files 
in your own directory. 

## Project Outline ## 

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
